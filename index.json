Multiple lines of evidence indicate that instruction on the relationship between spellings and sounds may be particularly important. However, it is unclear whether the effectiveness of this form of instruction depends on pre-existing oral language knowledge. To investigate this issue, we developed a series of computational models of reading incorporating orthographic, phonological and semantic processing to simulate both artificial and natural orthographic learning conditions in adults and children. We exposed the models to instruction focused on spelling-sound or spelling-meaning relationships, and tested the influence of the models’ oral language proficiency on the effectiveness of these training regimes. Overall, the simulations indicated that oral language proficiency is a vital foundation for reading acquisition, and may modulate the effectiveness of reading instruction. These results provide a computational basis for the Simple View of Reading, and emphasise the importance of both oral language knowledge and spelling-sound instruction in the initial stages of learning to read.","tags":[],"title":"The relationships between oral language and reading instruction: Evidence from a computational model of reading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ya-Ning Chang**","Chia-Ying Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1595628289,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1595628289,"objectID":"80101a2e5a8cc09818352a749fefaffd","permalink":"https://yaningchang.github.io/publication/aoa_chinese/","publishdate":"2020-07-24T23:04:49+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/aoa_chinese/","section":"publication","summary":"Across languages, age of acquisition (AoA) is a critical psycholinguistic factor in lexical processing, reflecting the influence of learning experience. Early-acquired words tend to be processed more quickly and accurately than late-acquired words. Recently, an integrated view proposed that both the mappings between representations and the construction of semantic representations contribute to AoA effects, thus, predicting larger AoA effects for words with arbitrary mappings between representations as well as for tasks requiring greater semantic processing. We investigated how these predictions generalize to the Chinese language system that differs from alphabetic languages regarding the ease of mappings and semantic involvement in lexical processing. A cross-task investigation of differential psycholinguistic effects was conducted with large character naming and lexical decision datasets to establish the extent to which semantics is involved in the two tasks. We focused on examining the effect sizes of lexical-semantic variables and AoA, and the interaction between AoA and consistency. The results demonstrated that semantics influenced Chinese character naming more than lexical decision, which is in contrast with the findings related to English language. Though, critically, AoA effects were more pronounced for character naming than for lexical decision. Additionally, an interaction between AoA and consistency was found in character naming.

When impaired, it has significant impacts on everyday life from social well being to quality of life. Therefore, understanding of the processes underlying normal, impaired and recovered language performance has been a long-standing goal for cognitive-clinical neuroscience. The vibrant studies of healthy language and impaired language have generated many verbally described hypotheses about language lateralisation and recovery. However, they have not been considered within a single, unified and implemented computational framework, and the literatures on healthy participants and patients are largely separated. These investigations also span different types of data, including behavioural results and fMRI brain activations, that augments the challenge for any unified theory. As a result, there are many key issues, apparent contradictions and puzzles that need to be solved. Here, we developed a neurocomputational, bilateral pathway model of spoken language production, designed to provide a unified framework to assimilate different types of data from healthy participants and aphasic patients. The model encapsulates various key computational principles (differential computational resources, emergent division of labour across pathways, experience-dependent plasticity-related recovery). In doing so, the model provides an explanation for the bilateral yet asymmetric lateralisation of language in healthy participants, chronic aphasia after left rather than right hemisphere lesions, and the basis of partial recovery of function in patients (reflecting a combination of retuning within the damage pathway and a changed division of labour across pathways). Also, the model provides a formal basis for understanding the relationship between behavioural performance and brain activation. Overall, the unified model is consistent with the degeneracy and variable displacement theories of language recovery, and adds computational insights to these hypotheses in terms of the neural machinery underlying language processing and plasticity-related recovery following damage.","tags":[],"title":"A unified neurocomputational bilateral pathway model of spoken language production in healthy participants and recovery in post-stroke aphasia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ya-Ning Chang**","Stephen Welbourne","Padraic Monaghan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572554387,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572554387,"objectID":"b46bc25b2fa157bfbe7486ad3997b882","permalink":"https://yaningchang.github.io/publication/aoa/","publishdate":"2019-10-31T21:39:47+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/aoa/","section":"publication","summary":"Cognitive development is shaped by interactions between cognitive architecture and environmental experiences of the growing brain.

We implemented a computational model including representations of print, sound and meaning of words, with training based on children’s gradual exposure to language. The model produced AoA effects in reading and lexical decision, replicating the larger effects of AoA when semantic representations are involved. Further, the model predicted that AoA would relate to differing use of the reading system, with words acquired before versus after literacy onset with distinctive accessing of meaning and sound representations. An analysis of behaviour from the English Lexicon project was consistent with the predictions: Words acquired before literacy are more likely to access meaning via sound, showing a suppressed AoA effect, whereas words acquired after literacy rely more on direct print to meaning mappings, showing an exaggerated AoA effect. The reading system reveals vestigial traces of acquisition reflected in differing use of word representations during reading.","tags":[],"title":"A computational model of reading across development: Effects of literacy onset on language processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ya-Ning Chang**","Padraic Monaghan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538596256,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538596256,"objectID":"cce9597e268675d82652ab671f1ca118","permalink":"https://yaningchang.github.io/publication/quantity_diversity/","publishdate":"2018-10-03T20:50:56+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/quantity_diversity/","section":"publication","summary":"Diversity of vocabulary knowledge and quantity of language exposure prior to literacy are key predictors of reading development.

The model first learned to map between phonology and semantics, where we manipulated the quantity and diversity of this preliterate language experience. Then the model learned to read.

A number of recent studies have provided objective ambiguity measures by using a corpus-based approach and demonstrated ambiguity advantage in both naming and lexical decision tasks. Although the predictive power of the objective ambiguity measures has been examined in several alphabetic language systems, the effects in logographic languages remain unclear. Moreover, most ambiguity measures do not explicitly address how various contexts associated with a given word relate to each other. To explore these issues, we computed contextual diversity (Adelman et al. 2006) and semantic ambiguity (Hoffman et al. 2013) of traditional Chinese single-character words based on the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus, where contextual diversity was used to evaluate the present semantic space. We then derived a novel ambiguity measure, namely semantic variability, by computing distance properties of the distinct clusters grouped by the contexts that contained a given word. We demonstrated that semantic variability was superior to semantic diversity in accounting for the variance in the naming RTs, suggesting that considering the substructure of various contexts associated with a given word can provide a relatively fine scale of ambiguity information for a word. All the context and ambiguity measures for 2,418 Chinese single-character words are provided as supplementary materials.

These differences in neighborhood effects between languages may depend on the characteristics (depth) of the mapping between orthography and phonology. To explore this, we first conducted a behavioral experiment to investigate the relationship between neighborhood size, consistency and reading response. The results showed an inhibitory effect of neighborhood size for inconsistent characters but a facilitatory effect for consistent characters. We then developed two computational models based on parallel distributed processing principles to try and capture the nature of the processing that leads to these results in Chinese character naming.

The ERP data revealed an orthographic consistency effect in the frontal-centrally distributed N400, and a homophone density effect in central-posteriorly distributed late positive component (LPC). Further source analyses using the standardized low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (sLORETA) demonstrated that the orthographic effect was not only localized in the frontal and temporal-parietal regions for phonological processing, but also in the posterior visual cortex for orthographic processing, while the homophone density effect was found in middle temporal gyrus for lexical-semantic selection, and in the temporal-occipital junction for orthographic processing.

For example, the spelling-to-sound consistency effect has been observed in visual word recognition tasks, in which the naming responses are faster and more accurate for words with the same letters that also have the same pronunciation (e.g. -ean is always pronounced /in/, as in lean, dean, and bean). In addition, some studies have reported a much less intuitive feedback consistency effect when a rime can be spelled in different ways (e.g. /ip/ in heap and deep) in lexical decision tasks. Such findings suggest that, with activation flowing back and forth between orthographic and phonological units during word processing, any inconsistency in the mappings between orthography and phonology should weaken the stability of the feedback loop, and, thus, should delay recognition. However, several studies have failed to show reliable feedback consistency in printed word recognition. One possible reason for this is that the feedback consistency is naturally confounded with many other variables, such as orthographic neighborhood or bigram frequency, as these variables are difficult to tease apart. Furthermore, there are challenges in designing factorial experiments that perfectly balance lexical stimuli on all factors besides feedback consistency. This study aims to examine the feedback consistency effect in reading Chinese characters by using a normative data of 3,423 Chinese phonograms. We collected the lexical decision time from 180 college students. A linear mixed model analysis was used to examine the feedback consistency effect by taking into account additional properties that may be confounded with feedback consistency, including character frequency, number of strokes, phonetic combinability, semantic combinability, semantic ambiguity, phonetic consistency, noun-to-verb ratios, and morphological boundedness. Some typical effects were observed, such as the more frequent and familiar a character, the faster one can decide it is a real character. More importantly, the linear mixed model analysis revealed a significant feedback consistency effect while controlling for other factors, which indicated that the pronunciation of phonograms might accommodate the organization of Chinese orthographic representation. Our study disentangled the feedback consistency from the many other factors, and supports the view that phonological activation would reverberate to orthographic representation in visual word recognition.","tags":[],"title":"The feedback consistency effect in Chinese character recognition: evidence from a psycholinguistic norm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ya-Ning Chang**","Steven Furber","Stephen Welbourne"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1349469795,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1349469795,"objectID":"a655aa0126fce24e16998c1da164c4f0","permalink":"https://yaningchang.github.io/publication/letter_recognition/","publishdate":"2012-10-05T21:43:15+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/letter_recognition/","section":"publication","summary":"Letter recognition is the foundation of the human reading system.

However, an alternative explanation of these data is that visual processes outside the scope of existing parallel models are responsible for generating the word-length related phenomena (Seidenberg \u0026 Plaut, 1998). Here we demonstrate that a parallel model of single word reading can account for the differential word-length effects found in the naming latencies of words and nonwords, provided that it includes a mapping from visual to orthographic representations, and that the nature of those orthographic representations are not preconstrained. The model can also simulate other supposedly “serial” effects. The overall findings were consistent with the view that visual processing contributes substantially to the word-length effects in normal reading and provided evidence to support the single-route theory which assumes words and nonwords are processed in parallel by a common mechanism.","tags":[],"title":"Serial effects in parallel models of reading","type":"publication"}]
