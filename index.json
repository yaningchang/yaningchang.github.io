When impaired, it has significant impacts on everyday life from social well being to quality of life. Therefore, understanding of the processes underlying normal, impaired and recovered language performance has been a long-standing goal for cognitive-clinical neuroscience. The vibrant studies of healthy language and impaired language have generated many verbally described hypotheses about language lateralisation and recovery. However, they have not been considered within a single, unified and implemented computational framework, and the literatures on healthy participants and patients are largely separated. These investigations also span different types of data, including behavioural results and fMRI brain activations, that augments the challenge for any unified theory. As a result, there are many key issues, apparent contradictions and puzzles that need to be solved. Here, we developed a neurocomputational, bilateral pathway model of spoken language production, designed to provide a unified framework to assimilate different types of data from healthy participants and aphasic patients. The model encapsulates various key computational principles (differential computational resources, emergent division of labour across pathways, experience-dependent plasticity-related recovery). In doing so, the model provides an explanation for the bilateral yet asymmetric lateralisation of language in healthy participants, chronic aphasia after left rather than right hemisphere lesions, and the basis of partial recovery of function in patients (reflecting a combination of retuning within the damage pathway and a changed division of labour across pathways). Also, the model provides a formal basis for understanding the relationship between behavioural performance and brain activation. Overall, the unified model is consistent with the degeneracy and variable displacement theories of language recovery, and adds computational insights to these hypotheses in terms of the neural machinery underlying language processing and plasticity-related recovery following damage.","tags":[],"title":"A unified neurocomputational bilateral pathway model of spoken language production in healthy participants and recovery in post-stroke aphasia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ya-Ning Chang**","J.

Using learning of artificial orthographies, studies have compared print-to-sound or print-to-meaning focused reading training and demonstrated that print-to-sound training is superior for learning to read. However, the extent to which this advantage is dependent on prior acquisition of effective oral language skills remains unclear. To explore this issue, we developed a series of computational models of reading incorporating orthographic, phonological and semantic processing to simulate both artificial and natural orthographic learning conditions in adults and children. We exposed the models to sound- or meaning-focused reading training, but tested the influence of the models’ oral language proficiency on the effectiveness of these training regimes. Overall, the simulations showed that oral language skills are a key determinant of the behavioural advantage of print-to-sound focused reading training. The results emphasise that early reading training should address development of both oral language skills and print-to-sound mappings.","tags":[],"title":"The relationships between oral language and reading instruction: Evidence from a computational model of reading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ya-Ning Chang**","Stephen Welbourne","Padraic Monaghan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1572554387,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1572554387,"objectID":"b46bc25b2fa157bfbe7486ad3997b882","permalink":"https://yaningchang.github.io/publication/aoa/","publishdate":"2019-10-31T21:39:47+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/aoa/","section":"publication","summary":"Cognitive development is shaped by interactions between cognitive architecture and environmental experiences of the growing brain. We examined the extent to which this interaction during development could be observed in language processing. We focused on age of acquisition (AoA) effects in reading, where early-learned words tend to be processed more quickly and accurately relative to later-learned words. We implemented a computational model including representations of print, sound and meaning of words, with training based on children’s gradual exposure to language. The model produced AoA effects in reading and lexical decision, replicating the larger effects of AoA when semantic representations are involved. Further, the model predicted that AoA would relate to differing use of the reading system, with words acquired before versus after literacy onset with distinctive accessing of meaning and sound representations. An analysis of behaviour from the English Lexicon project was consistent with the predictions: Words acquired before literacy are more likely to access meaning via sound, showing a suppressed AoA effect, whereas words acquired after literacy rely more on direct print to meaning mappings, showing an exaggerated AoA effect. The reading system reveals vestigial traces of acquisition reflected in differing use of word representations during reading.","tags":[],"title":"A computational model of reading across development: Effects of literacy onset on language processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ya-Ning Chang**","Padraic Monaghan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538596256,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538596256,"objectID":"cce9597e268675d82652ab671f1ca118","permalink":"https://yaningchang.github.io/publication/quantity_diversity/","publishdate":"2018-10-03T20:50:56+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/quantity_diversity/","section":"publication","summary":"Diversity of vocabulary knowledge and quantity of language exposure prior to literacy are key predictors of reading development. However, diversity and quantity of exposure are difficult to distinguish in behavioural studies, and so the causal relations with literacy are not well known. We tested these relations by training a connectionist triangle model of reading that learned to map between semantic; phonological; and, later, orthographic forms of words. The model first learned to map between phonology and semantics, where we manipulated the quantity and diversity of this preliterate language experience. Then the model learned to read. Both diversity and quantity of exposure had unique effects on reading performance, with larger effects for written word comprehension than for reading fluency. The results further showed that quantity of preliteracy language exposure was beneficial only when this was to a varied vocabulary and could be an impediment when exposed to a limited vocabulary.","tags":[],"title":"Quantity and diversity of pre-literacy language exposure both affect literacy development: Evidence from a computational model of reading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ya-Ning Chang**","Chia-Ying Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1509738656,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509738656,"objectID":"ab8651f48c09fb3050a92cec8f9e46bb","permalink":"https://yaningchang.github.io/publication/semantic_ambiguity/","publishdate":"2017-11-03T20:50:56+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/semantic_ambiguity/","section":"publication","summary":"Words are considered semantically ambiguous if they have more than one meaning and can be used in multiple contexts. A number of recent studies have provided objective ambiguity measures by using a corpus-based approach and demonstrated ambiguity advantage in both naming and lexical decision tasks. Although the predictive power of the objective ambiguity measures has been examined in several alphabetic language systems, the effects in logographic languages remain unclear. Moreover, most ambiguity measures do not explicitly address how various contexts associated with a given word relate to each other. To explore these issues, we computed contextual diversity (Adelman et al. 2006) and semantic ambiguity (Hoffman et al. 2013) of traditional Chinese single-character words based on the Academia Sinica Balanced Corpus, where contextual diversity was used to evaluate the present semantic space. We then derived a novel ambiguity measure, namely semantic variability, by computing distance properties of the distinct clusters grouped by the contexts that contained a given word. We demonstrated that semantic variability was superior to semantic diversity in accounting for the variance in the naming RTs, suggesting that considering the substructure of various contexts associated with a given word can provide a relatively fine scale of ambiguity information for a word. All the context and ambiguity measures for 2,418 Chinese single-character words are provided as supplementary materials.

A key variable accounting for much variance in lexical processing is frequency, but the size of the frequency effect has been demonstrated to reduce as a consequence of the individual’s vocabulary size. Using a connectionist computational implementation of the triangle model on a large set of English words, where orthographic, phonological, and semantic representations interact during processing, we show that the model demonstrates a reduced frequency effect as a consequence of amount of exposure to the language, a variable that was also a cause of greater vocabulary size in the model. The model was also trained to learn a second language, Dutch, and replicated behavioural observations that increased proficiency in a second language resulted in reduced frequency effects for that language but increased frequency effects in the first language. The model provides a first step to demonstrating causal relations between psycholinguistic variables in a model of individual differences in lexical processing, and the effect of bilingualism on interacting variables within the language processing system.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring the relations between word frequency, language exposure, and bilingualism in a computational model of reading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Ya-Ning Chang**","Stephen Welbourne","Chia-Ying Lee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1480797056,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1480797056,"objectID":"fab76b7fe254fafd5760cd428696d39a","permalink":"https://yaningchang.github.io/publication/chinese_model/","publishdate":"2016-12-03T21:30:56+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/chinese_model/","section":"publication","summary":"Orthographic neighborhood (N) size effects have been extensively studied in English consistently producing a facilitatory effect in word naming tasks. In contrast, several recent studies on Chinese character naming have demonstrated an inhibitory effect of neighborhood size. Response latencies tend to be inhibited by inconsistent characters with large neighborhoods relative to small neighborhoods. These differences in neighborhood effects between languages may depend on the characteristics (depth) of the mapping between orthography and phonology. To explore this, we first conducted a behavioral experiment to investigate the relationship between neighborhood size, consistency and reading response. The results showed an inhibitory effect of neighborhood size for inconsistent characters but a facilitatory effect for consistent characters. We then developed two computational models based on parallel distributed processing principles to try and capture the nature of the processing that leads to these results in Chinese character naming. Simulations using models based on the triangle model of reading indicated that consistency and neighborhood size interact with the division of labor between semantics and phonology to produce these effects.","tags":[],"title":"Exploring orthographic neighborhood size effects in a computational model of Chinese character naming","type":"publication"}]
